# bakery-game.py
PROJECT SUMMARY
This game is a 2D arcade-style game that was built in Python using the extension pygame. You are playing as a chef. The goal is to collect the bakery items which are the bread and cupcakes while trying to avoid the enemy which is the rat. As the game progresses the game gets harder with power up and the rat increases his speed. The goal of this game was to create a fun experience with visuals, sound effects, and a smooth gameplay.  

HOW TO PLAY 
Use the arrows up, down, and side to side to move the chef around the screen
Collect the bakery items to increase the score 
Collect the cupcakes for extra lives 
Avoid the rat as the collision will take a life
The game will end when you have no more lives 

TECHNOLOGIES 
Python 3.11
Thonny 
Pygame for graphics, game loop, and sound 
Sprite design for the characters and items 
PNG images for the chef, rat, cupcake, and bread

WHAT I LEARNED 
I learned all about the use of images and the collision aspect of the game. I have gotten stuck with that in the past so I used resources to help me with that. I learned the different aspects of how to use Thonny to the best of my abilities, and the different code that can be used with the program for this game. 

WHERE I GOT STUCK 
I had trouble getting the images to work with the Thonny program. I figured out that my pictures were not downloaded under the same folder so when I figured that out it got a lot easier. I still can not figure out the sound aspect of the game which is why I put in code where the game can start when the sound does not work. I still had trouble with the enemy character moving all around the screen without the user controlling that part as well. 




WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY 
Next time I would take more time learning and researching the sound aspect of the game earlier on, so I would have time to make sure that it works. I would also make it a 2 person game where one person controls the rat and one controls the chef. I would have liked to include more powerups but when I tried to do that I could not figure that part out. 

GAME DESIGN DOC
I did not stray from the game design doc because I knew that if I did I would not have enough time to do everything because once I have a nothing thing that I think about I know I would have wanted to change everything. 

HOW I STAYED ON TRACK 
I made a checklist of everything that I wanted to get done each day and tried to stick to that. Some days I got too busy so I made sure to add that task to the next day. I made sure to text the game multiple times towards the end to figure out what kinks I still needed to work out.
